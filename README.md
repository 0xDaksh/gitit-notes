LaTeX Notes
===========
These are the LaTeX transcriptions of various notes I maintain.

Current books taken into consideration:

For organizational purposes, files are prefixed according to the category I've placed them in. Additionally, a number following the
prefix refers to the book the notes were pulled from. If notes are collected from several books, we separate numbers with an underscore.
Books and the chapters in question are also explicitly mentioned in the LaTeX file themselves.
